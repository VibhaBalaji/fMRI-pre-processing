# fMRI-pre-processing

Raw fMRI data from LONI's ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database is downloaded. Codes in this repository can be used with the FSL tool (run through bash scripts) to pre-process the data. 

Included are bash scripts for various stages of pre-processing that run on Linux, and Python scripts to mask the data to SPM's AAL90 atlas.
